All you are doing is harassing a single individual trying to make their living. Most telemarketers hate their jobs and don’t want to be calling you anyway, but many feel they have no their skills and are just trying to earn a roof over their heads or feed their kids. It’s completely ineffective against the telemarketing industry or scammers who hire the folks on the phone. Why not ask to speak to someone higher up and aks for thier name, address, legal department? Your time would be better spent reporting the company to the proper government entity (FTC?).\n","I\n","------------------------------\n","<Scam record #46>\n","In short, because I was lonely and vulnerable at that point, so I guess I was easy prey.

If they do call you, it will be all lies and broken promises. They will tell you they love you, they want to come to your country to marry you. A scammer will call you to build a rapport with you, a scammer is trying to find your weakness to use to manipulate you. They want to control you like a puppet. They become more aggressive with you and try to feed on your emotions. They want you to feel guilty. Scammers do call you to try to figure you out.
