1,"My wife does this all the time.
Scammy: We need to repair the operating system on your computer.
Wife: Ok, I don’t know anything about computers so you will have to help me.
Scammy: Go to your computer.
Wife: I am there
Scammy: Go into your windows.
WIfe: Ok but I thought we were fixing my computer?
Scammy: We are:"
2,"I might be a little biased, but as an Asana employee, I believe Asana is the best project management tool. With Asana, my entire team has a central source of truth so they know exactly who’s doing what by when. We can track all of our tasks and stay aligned on our team goals. This has been especially important recently, since it’s enabled our team to manage shifting priorities and take any new challenges in stride.
Every team is different, so your team might not use Asana exactly like my team does. But every team can benefit from more clarity, coordination, and collaboration at work. Here are f"
3,"Ok so there will be some Spanglish in this one because it wasn't me who got the call but my grandma.
Just to give you guys a bit of back story: so my grandma straight up came from Mexico without being able to read and no educational background so she is pretty vulgar when she speaks. She also had 20 children but only 9 remain. All of her children are fully grown with families and kids of their own.
So there is this common phone scam that Mexicans do where they will look up mainly Spanish speaking people’s number and tell the receiver that they are a cousin. The scammer says “do you recognize my"
4,"My FAVORITE calls, by far! I figure the few minutes it takes to frustrate the bejesus out of them enough to make them hang up is well worth the effort. As several others have indicated, it does tend to get you OFF their call lists! For some reason, my mother is always taken in by these idiots, so turnabout is fair play. The Microsoft guys are my favorite ones to play with, since I work in the telecom industry.
Caller (with strong middle eastern accent) introduces himself as a rep from Microsoft, and they have detected a virus in my computer. Probably a good thing they can’t see me, because my e"
5,"Absolutely! I must admit, I am not the best at messing with scammers, but I've had a couple good moments. One time a scammer called about my Windows computer being compromised and requiring immediate attention (this is the most common scam). On this occasion, I decided to only speak in less than mediocre Serbian to this guy to see for how long he would hold out. To my amazement, while he never spoke any Serbian back to me, he actually understood almost everything I spoke to him and remained confident. Then at some point, he passed me along to his supervisor, with whom I continued to speak in b"
6,"I had a run of “Windows Support” calls over several weeks. On one occasion I strung them on for nearly 40 minutes, but that’s another story.
This particular night I was in the middle of cooking dinner, and in a rush. Phone rings with a withheld number. I answer it, and hear “Sir, we are calling from Windows Support, you have very bad virus.”
I quickly wailed down the phone “I don’t wanna diiiiiiieeeeee” and added fake sobbing on the end.
He quickly stammered “No no no, not you sir, your computer have very bad virus.”
I roared down the phone “how dare you tell me I have a bad virus and make me thin"
7,"Original question: Have you ever received a scam phone call and played along with the scammer only for them to hang up?
Most times I don’t, sometimes I do. The most glorious and rather unexpected triumph was when I pissed a so called “Microsoft” scammer off to the extend that, on a bitter tone and apparently through clenched teeth, he said: “May I ask you one more question?”
Being curious I returned: “Sure, go ahead”.
And then it came: “Do you often f*ck your mother?”
My instant reply: “No. Only yours” put him into a screaming fit that after a couple of happy seconds I disconnected with a profound"
8,"I got this call almost everyday sometimes multiples, lower your interest rate bla bla bla. It was a recording and I was tired of it.
When the recording said push 3 for assistance I did. I was hoping to ask to be put on their do no call list. I got a man with a thick foreign accent, who claims he is Stanley.
I tell him I received calls so many times and I am not interested could I please be put on their do not call list? He asks me to hold. He comes back and asks me to repeat what I had said. I repeated to put me on the do not call list.
Up till then he used a sing song type voice very happy go lu"
9,"Adware is a type of malware that invades your computer and changes the settings of your browser without your knowledge or permission.
After installing, adware redirects you to other websites and reroutes your searches. Then your browser displays annoying pop-ups and advertisements, or constantly displays intrusive ads.
Typically, adware infects your PC through third-party apps, browser extensions, or fake software update notifications.
As soon as adware is installed, it can cause irreparable damage by stealing sensitive information like your credit card information, passwords, etc. You may also n"
10,"I keep an old laptop setup just for scammers who phone me on a regular basis as I work form home. I have removed all my personal stuff and populated the files with interesting things for them including some porn photos+videos and a file with fake bank account numbers and passwords.
I let them get in via Teamviewer and enjoy listing to their bullshit and watching them steal my planted files.
I usually manage to spin them along for an hour giving false credit card info etc until they eventually catch on. When one guy realized, he activated my webcam (which is taped over) and showed me his penis.
I"
11,"There is a scam that people pretend that they are your colleague from a remote office and try to have you let them in to do something. No idea what they actually want, as never had the patience to listen to them. Anyhow I got the usual call from an unknown number. Heavy accent.
-Hey, this is Microsoft, Microsoft, Illes, Illes from Microsoft?
-Yes what can I do for you?
-It is … from Microsoft America
Scammers. If any of you out there. Please do your homework. There is no such thing as Microsoft America. And even if there was, no one would use the name in an initial introduction. You are always usi"
12,"Yes. It happened today. I received a robocall telling me that a package I was about to receive was confiscated by the federal government and they found drugs, cash, and contraband in the package and to press number one to speak to somebody. So I pressed number one and with a very good Spanish accent had a conversation with the gentleman on the other end of the line. I asked him where my two kilos of cocaine were that had been shipped to me from Columbia (sorry Colombia no offense). Told him that my brother had paid $300,000 Colombian pesos in Bogota for 5-day shipping. I started speaking Spani"
13,"Hell yeh! I love stringing them along and see how long it takes before THEY hang up on me. I’m aware that if they call me and if they’re unable to scam money out of me, it deprives them that time for them to pull the scam on someone else. Here’s a few that I’ve experienced first hand …
Bogus call from the Australian Taxation Office or ATO (ie. equivalent to the IRS in the USA): They start off with a recorded message saying they're from the ATO and you are being sued blah blah blah ... So I hung up on them and decided to call them back. A guy with an Indian accent answers, and says something ind"
14,"Yes.
I received several calls back to back when I was first moving to my new address, so I was already aggravated. This guy wanted my credit card/bank info so that he could “send” me the prize money that I had apparently won. The conversation went like this:
Scammer: Hello? Am I speaking with Angelica Black?
Me: Yes, who’s this?
Scammer: I’m Edward from (I forget where, it was back in June of last year. He also had a very strong Middle Eastern/Indian accent.)
Me: Ok, what do you want? (Normally, I’m not rude, but I was moving and already kinda peeved off.)"
15,"I routinely get phone calls telling me that they have been trying to get in touch with me, and that this is my last chance to take advantage of the offer to extend my car’s warranty. They ask me to give them the year, make, and model of my vehicle and I will be given an offer to buy an extended warranty. So, I hesitate momentarily and then I tell the caller that I don’t think that the company will offer me a warranty on my car. Then I am told that they will make that determination. I tell the caller that I have 4 cars and I ask which car they have been trying to get in touch with me about. I g"
16,"Yes, this was my favourite, done by a friend of mine when he was a passenger in my car.
Scammer Hello, we are calling about the accident you had.
Friend oh thank goodness, I have been waiting for your call
Scammer sorry to have kept you waiting, we are looking into this now
Friend, great, have you found him yet.
Scammer, who do you mean?
Friend, well the one that caused the accident
Scammer, we are looking into it sir, can I take the details of your claim?"
17,"Last month I received a call from a girl claiming to be from Xiomi India. She told me that my phone number was chosen as some kind of random lucky winner and I'll be receiving Redmi Note 7 Pro as a gift at just ₹4,500."
18,"I got a call from my electric company… So I thought. Somehow they spoofed our electric company’s phone number and that’s why I picked up.
He proceeded to tell me that my power will be cut off any moment now and that I needed to pay the bill ASAP.
I rent properties, so the first thing I asked was whats the name on the account. He name one of my company names who I knew I never turned power on with that account name, so I said, oh.. ok..sure that’s ok, go ahead and turn it off!
He said: F*%K YOU! Why you waste my time! Then hung up on me.
Afterwards, I’m like, you’re trying to scam me, and then you"
19,"Yes, I have a Perfect story for this question
Note: it will be a long one
There was one account selling Iphone 12 Max for ₹9500/-. I played along. I knew all the while it is a scam and I am a B.tech CSE student as well so i tracked him down while i was playing along convincing him that I am an Easy Prey. Here are some Chat proofs:"
20,"I got a phone call from a person claiming to represent the US Government. He wanted to speak to my (adult) daughter, but I was suspicious, and asked him for details. He said that she had missed jury duty, and was about to be arrested, but if we acted quickly, we could avert the damage.
I told him that I wanted to protect her, and that, if possible, it would be best if she never even learned about the problem. What could I do? He said that for a $500 fee, they could expedite a document that would avoid all prosecution. I said I would do that; how do we proceed? He said we could meet at a local C"
21,"As a sex worker, I almost always got paid in cash.
But once in a while, clients would ask me for different options, since they didn’t have cash with them.
One time, I got booked in a nearby town. Usually, when I traveled, I required a 50% deposit, which clients paid by sending me the money through PayPal.
The client that I was meeting with sent me the deposit, booked a hotel, and everything was set.
I went to where I was supposed to, checked in, and waited for him. He arrived and wanted to send the remaining money through PayPal as well. I didn’t think that it was going to be a problem, so I agree"
22,"Sometimes, when I’m feeling playful, I will decide to answer the phone and have a fun conversation with a telemarketer. There was a time in college when I felt extra silly, and decided to call one of the late night televangelist shows.
There was a show that came on late at night on one of our basic college channels. I don’t remember the name of the show, but it featured Dr. Gene Scott."
23,"Yes, I’ve done this in the days when they still called me. I must have ended up on a blacklist…
Typical situation starts like David Cook’s answer. From here to help you
:
My first attempt to offer him support didn't work: he didn't understand (clearly not in his script). His first question: “Are you running Microsoft windows?” Me: “Of course not”. “What is your operating system?” “FreeBSD”. “What is your operating system?” “FreeBSD”. “What is your operating system?” “FreeBSD”. Finally he gave up and said “are you running windows?” That's clear: “yes, of course”. “Which version? XP, Vista or Windo"
24,"The usual bank-account-in-peril charade.
Scammer: Hello sir, I'm sorry but your bank account is going to be blocked within the next couple of hours, and you won't be able to make any kind of transaction. To prevent that, we just need a few details from you.
Me: Definitely.
Scammer: Please state your 16 digit debit card number, and if you can turn the card around, you'll see a 3 digit CVV number too. After that you'll get an OTP (one time password) on your phone via SMS. This is a 3 step verification that is a standard procedure for us to verify your account and keep it active.
Me: That's it? Fair"
25,"Twice.
First I get a call from Eric. Eric has a very strong Indian accent but I let that pass. “How is that Viagra working for you?” Eric asks. “Does your girlfriend like it?”
“Well, yes, it’s working very well. Thank you for asking. In fact, I believe it’s beginning to work right now, Eric.” Then I change into my sultry voice, “Eric, Baby, what are you wearing?”
Click.
Second time could also have been Eric. Sounded the same to me.
“Hello, sir? I am calling from Microsoft Labs to tell you that your computer is infected with a virus. I need to clean it for you.”"
26,"Yep. I had a “stock broker” from New York city call. Said that he had some stock to sell. I thanked him for the tip and said that i would check with my broker…. He said that that was a stupid idea and hung up on me.
Another time someone said that the warranty on my car was about to expire and he wanted to “extend” the warranty on my car He asked to “confirm” the make and model. I told him to tell me what he thought that i had and i would tell him if he had the right one.. He said that he only had the VIN so i asked him to read it off so i could tell if he had the right car. He hung up- on me….
A"
27,"DEFINITELY! Online, I scared one of them just by using Google maps. One gave me an address (this whole time, I was at my computer) and I started saying stuff like, “are you near [location of something close to the address]?” One asked where I was (and I'm at home on Google maps) and then I'd ask, (using street view) “ which house is yours?” The scammer didn't know I was bluffing; but said, “don't come over. He'll kill me!” I already knew that he/she didn't live there; but, I love to come back at them with what they wouldn't think of. Gotta love Google maps! On the phone, I’d do other stupid st"
28,"Similar to others, the usual Microsoft calling about a “bad virus” that has infected my computer. I had nothing special going on at that time do I played along. I wasn’t anywhere near my computer, as a matter of fact I was relaxing outside when the questions started. Scammer: can you turn.on your computer? Me: oh sure, it’s been kind of slow so it may take a couple of minutes. (Sounds of shuffling around) Scammer: did you get it turned on? Me: no, not yet, I’m not sure what the problem is… (another pause, now going on 7–8 minutes, more shuffling). Scammer: any luck yet? Me: I think it’s starti"
29,"Several years ago I received a phone call late at night on our home phone line and when I answered a man with a unintelligible accent, began to profusely congratulate me on my good fortune of winning their prestigious, didn't catch the name, award.
And all I had to do was deposit $50.00 In an “assured” account to provide an insurance policy, completely refundable upon my “reception"" of my “monies"" according to my “scammer”.
Me: “Oh, that's great, honey we've won!” I yelled to my Wife who was in the kitchen at the time
The Wife: “Won! Won what?” “What is it, a trip to an Iraqi battlefield, wouldn'"
30,"It wasn’t a phone call. Someone messaged me on Twitter pretending to be a lottery winner and was going around asking people if they needed money. Claimed they had paid someone’s medical bills, college tuition, etc. Showed “proof”
I went on and on about what an angel they were, helping so many people. They would always response - “how much money do you need?”
I would reply, “oh no, I’m blessed thank you. Don’t need a dime but I do think you’re wonderful for what you’re doing”.
They would constantly push the money again. Lots of messages back and forth over the course of 2 days. Finally, the person"
31,"I played along with one, I got them to talk about my work. I told them I kidnapped young children in malls. I talked a bit about how in the child kidnapping business you really need to specialize. The market for Eastern European Children is pretty good.
Then I got on to the whole distribution aspect. While they might get a better price overseas, the shipping costs mount up quickly. It’s best to stick with the domestic child slavery market. The US Postal Service works best, especially if you snatch young Eastern Europeans kids. Saves on the shipping costs.
Then I got back to what they were talkin"
32,"Yes, I have definitely received a scam phone call before and played along with the scammer. I was once scammed out of $200 by someone who pretended to be from the IRS. They called me and said that I owed money and if I didn't pay it immediately, I would be arrested. At first, I was scared and didn't know what to do. But then I realized that it was a scam and that they were just trying to take advantage of me. So, I started asking them questions and pretending like I was going along with it.
Then I signed up for Spokeo
, which helped me to track down the caller's information. And I was right abou"
33,"I like the sales people who just won’t take no for an answer. Had one call about windows. Told him I was absolutely not interested in new replacement windows and he still goes on pitching the windows. My football game comes on and I start to watch it, going unhuh, that's nice, wow, this goes on till half time which is about an hour later. Then he asks me where we can meet to sign the papers. What papers? The ones for the windows. What windows? Told you I am not interested in new windows. Now he steps it up about saving money and how nice they would look, etc. etc. You really have a problem wit"
34,"About 4–5 years ago I would get repeated phone calls from “Heather” offering to lower my credit cards’ interest rates. Since I always pay in full I wasn’t interested, besides knowing it must be a scam.
One time I had a few boring minutes, so I responded. A guy asks me how many credit cards I use. I say 5. “What interest rates they carry?” I blurt out 23%. Ok, says the guy, I can lower them to 8%. “That’s nice!” I say.
”Ok, what’s the number of the first card?” He casually says. “Excuse me?” I respond. “I need the card number so I can lower your rate.” Says the genius. “So you want me to give"
35,"Every night for months at the same time I would get a phone call. There would just be breathing on the other end. I didn’t have caller ID in those days, but I didn’t want to let the call go either because it could be a friend. I got so sick of these annoying calls that I spoke with a phone operator to see what could be done. With her advice this is what I did for the next call with the breather: Phone rings. I say hello….When I heard breathing I said, “yes operator this is the number I want traced”. Then I hit random buttons so it made different tone sounds. The other person quickly hung up an"
36,"No, but a of friend of my brother, did. His friend G lived in an apartment, and one day he received a call from a guy trying to sell him vinyl siding. The guy did what most phone solicitors do, and tell you some of your neighbors had already been contacted and several neighbors had already signed up to have siding installed on their homes. Since G lived in an apartment, he knew that was a crock, since all his neighbors were apartment dwellers, like himself. Since G had nothing better to do, he decided to play with the guy and waste his time, like many a phone solicitors had done to him and oth"
37,"Yes. A few weeks ago I received a call from someone purporting to be from my electric utility company (PPL), saying they had a ""better rate"" to offer me. The call came from one of those ""spoofed"" phone numbers -- not PPL. I asked the young lady again, if she was calling from PPL, and she said ""yes."" So I asked her why wasn't PPL showing up on my caller ID (I had received in the mail, along with my monthly bill, a brochure from PPL advising customers about these scam tactics). She said she needed my account number for verification. I asked her, ""if she was truly calling from PPL, she would alre"
38,"I get calls from my internet “supplier” (insert any name here) so I roll my eyes and launch, screaming at them “About time you finally returned my call, what are you going to do to correct YOUR fault on my line!” They try to get a word in and say there is a probl…… and I start again “what are THEY going to do about it!” As an ex telecoms IT and I make them fully aware I am, “pointing out I have identified the issue as being with their equipment, not mine” and have them starting to get apologetic and say they can fix it if……, interrupt them again and say “no ifs, and or buts, what exactly are Y"
39,"I’ve had the calls about lowering my electric bill and they ask me to find my electric bill. I say ok and put the phone down, 5 minutes go by and I hear the gut saying sir, sir, I pic up the phone and say I’m still looking for my gas bill then put the phone back down for a few minutes. I the pick it up and tell him I’m looking for my water bill, he says no your electric bill, I say oh ok I will look for my gas bill then. I then pick up the phone and tell him I have my water bill and he says, sir I think you have a problem with short term memory. I then told him I would get my sewer bill and be"

41,"While some may enjoy spending their time messing with these crooks, and that’s perfectly fine with me, I have no time for them. They can call me all they like, but if I don’t recognize the number (displayed in several locations in my house), I ignore it.
These creeps spoof their caller ID info and use auto dialers capable of dialing every last number there is, landline or cell. But the phone company cries poverty and antiquated equipment, letting them get away with it. I’m guessing if they really wanted to, they could put an end to it. Probably using it as an excuse to double our phone bills fo"
42,Yes recently one of my friend received a message telling they want to help poor people .
43,"1st , I usually answer the phone with “ Thank you for calling TG&Y ! “ ( business closed for the last 25 years ) . And I do it with a terrible Indian accent . Seems to shut them down almost immediately .
But my favorite is the social security scam . I made up a fictitious name , social security number , and spent 3 days going back and forth with the same guy . Told him , I have no bank account , no credit cards , and 50k in my safe !
he finally had enough , cussed me out and hung up .
The best part of it all is my alias is in their system and will hang up directly after typing in the name 🤣"
44,"All the time. I am an Independent developer and usually I just say something like “it must be one of the new builds, let's get (insert random name usually “John”) from R&D on the line.
Them “what?”
Yah, “John from R&D, which department are you in, anyway?”
Them, absolutely confused….. “Um Im from Microsoft bla bla bla”
Me ignoring the obvious confusion “okay John is on Skype, now can you tell me what error you have on your end so ee can track tthis down.”
Eventually after a bunch of technobable word salad and them getting more and more confused."
45,"No. It is a complete waste of time. All you are doing is harassing a single individual trying to make their living. Most telemarketers hate their jobs and don’t want to be calling you anyway, but many feel they have no their skills and are just trying to earn a roof over their heads or feed their kids. It’s completely ineffective against the telemarketing industry or scammers who hire the folks on the phone. Why not ask to speak to someone higher up and aks for thier name, address, legal department? Your time would be better spent reporting the company to the proper government entity (FTC?).
I"
46,"In short, because I was lonely and vulnerable at that point, so I guess I was easy prey. They didn't realize I'm also very astute and a quick learner. I saw all the red flags early on, felt something was off, but still continued contact. Eventually it reached the point to where my denial made no sense even to me.
Once I fully knew this, my continued contact was mainly for the company, although I knew she wasn't who she claimed to be. It became like a game or a penpal. Eventually, once she figured out that the money had dried up on my end, she drifted away.
All I can recommend is be careful, and"
47,"Me: Hello?
Scammer: Hello, is this the residence of Mr. Jones? This is Agent Smith with the IRS and we have an outstanding tax warrant for $1,250 payable immediately.
Me: One moment please while I see if he’s available...

Scammer: ...hello?...
Me: (from a distance) One sec please...
Scammer: Ok."
48,"Yes! We catch them all the time when people come in and report scam phone calls to us. At the Sheriff’s office I work for, we have called back scammers and caught them impersonating officers, asking for money, and when we told them we were calling from the Sheriff’s office he was representing, he then said, “Oh I don’t work for the Sheriff’s office, I work for Pizza Hut”. We then informed him he w"
49,"I do not know if this is a correct answer, but . . . . . . .
A lady friend of mine was becoming more upset with a heavy breather phone calls.
One day, when I was visiting, this pervert called again. I motioned to her to give me the phone. The one sided conversation went as follows - -
“Hello. Due to your breathing sound, I can deduce that you are a fellow sufferer of Asthma. Luckily I have experienced this problem for a number of years and I am happy to share my expertise with you.”
As I am able to have one sided conversations (ask any of my friends) I then continued to list the medications availa"
50,"Absolutely! A guy tried to get me to cash a fake check once and once I realized it was a scam (it seemed like an actual job offer at first) I played along until I had gotten as much of his personal information as I could, which was far more than he wanted to give but I can be pretty persuasive when I put my mind to it. I then informed him that I had been arrested cashing the check and was working for the FBI and encouraged him to get out of town while he still could because they had been tracing our calls and were on their way.
I'm not exactly sure what language he reverted to at that point, it"

if that doesn’t work, i say “who is your CEO?” they usually hang up after that one
you can also say things like “how did you know that about me” if they say something like your address or something else about you that’s correct
you can also ask for their number to phone them back
you can also ask for their full name and location
you can ask them what they’re wearing
you can ask them what sort of parents they have that they would become scammers, and shame on them"
52,"Nope never have. In fact some asshole tried very hard to convince me I had a bill I knew I didn’t have. He went totally fucktard and threatened to fuck the female members of my family. Yeah, at that point I got pissed, trying to scam me is one thing, threatening my family is another. I traced his call and called him back and informed him I knew his exact location and that for all he knew I was in route to his location. I also informed him his only chance was to leave the fucking planet. I don’t know what his thoughts were after that, but he was scared. He was so stupid that he had no knowledge"
53,"I work in tech support for the oil and gas industry. I use my work phone and my personal cell phone. I receive a stipend for using my personal cell phone that covers some of the costs.
I answer the phone more than most. Unless I know the number or the caller I always answer the same. Tech support, this is Donovan. This eliminates half of the scam and or sales calls.
For some of the calls I use sarcasm and I ask specific questions. “Our records show that you have stayed at our resorts in the past…” “I see. Which resort was that. I would like to thank them for extending this offer.” Then there is"
54,"Yes, scammers have been known to call from time to time. If they do call you, it will be all lies and broken promises. They will tell you they love you, they want to come to your country to marry you. A scammer will call you to build a rapport with you, a scammer is trying to find your weakness to use to manipulate you. They want to control you like a puppet. They become more aggressive with you and try to feed on your emotions. They want you to feel guilty. Scammers do call you to try to figure you out. Most of the time a scammer will text you and it will be brief, same thing talking to them"
55,"Yes, I have. But today most of these scammers are either a prerecorded line that’s simply attempting to route you to an auotmated scam or one that sells your information down the stream to less sophisticated operations that still use live people. Most of the live people are now more willing to make threats of physical and other natures and then hang up on you. Some of them will atttempt to get you to acquiesce to some small thing in order to build a fake level of rapport, such as asking you to speak up or calm down. Never, never, never, neverr acquiesce. They called you and are trying to scam"
56,Well my scammer Liam brown (fake name) never hung up on me over the phone. But he did blocked me on hangouts because when I found out he was a Oil rig scammer I confronted him and he denied that he was a romance scammer. So I kept telling him all the lies he had told me plus I sent him the picture of the guy that was in my picture hugging with another guy.the guy in the picture was not interested in women. I told him everything all day everyday so he got fed up and blocked me. But he came back after two months and tried and I was in love with the guy I was talking to. He had to be in a Nigeria
