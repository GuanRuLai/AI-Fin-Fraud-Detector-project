1,"My favorite is the “Grandma I’m in trouble call.” I have neither spouse nor children, so it is difficult to imagine how I would have acquired a grandchild.
“Grandma, How are you?”
“OK.”
“Do you know who this is?”
“Of course, I know my own grandson.”
“Grandma, how are you doing?”
“Not so good, honey. Actually, I am in real trouble. I was on the way home from church, and the police officer was really very nice when he stopped me. He just did not understand that your grandpa really needs his medicinal marijuana. So I have been charged with possession with intent to distribute. I am so glad you called."
2,"I might be a little biased, but as an Asana employee, I believe Asana is the best project management tool. With Asana, my entire team has a central source of truth so they know exactly who’s doing what by when. We can track all of our tasks and stay aligned on our team goals. This has been especially important recently, since it’s enabled our team to manage shifting priorities and take any new challenges in stride.
Every team is different, so your team might not use Asana exactly like my team does. But every team can benefit from more clarity, coordination, and collaboration at work. Here are f"
3,"I had the “I’m calling to fix your Windows” call. I played the dumb as a rock woman.
Me: “Finally! I’ve been waiting all day for you guys to show up!”
Scammer: “No, we don’t come to your house. I fix your Windows.”
Me: “Well of course you do, and it has a big crack in it. Your company said you would be here today, and I’ve been waiting all day.”
Scammer: “Lady, I’m fixing the Windows on your computer.”
Me: “Oh my goodness! You mean you can fix that too? Great! But I need the living room window fixed first, the rain is getting in, and we’re having a problem with birds flying in. One has even started"
4,"One time, I was hanging out at my grandmother’s house, and she got a phone call. This was a few years ago, when she only had two grandkids - me and my brother.
When my grandma looked at the caller ID, she didn’t recognize the number, so she winked at me, and answered the phone, putting it on speakerphone.
Scammer: Hey, Grandma, I just wanted to ask for a little bit of help. I’m stuck in New York. I went there, but I didn’t have enough money to get back.
Now, this voice was distinctly female, maybe in their twenties. I’m only fifteen, and I was ten or eleven, maybe twelve, when this call was takin"
5,"A young woman, perhaps in her early twenties by the sound of her voice, called me pretending to be from Microsoft. She had an American accent and was very pleasant. I acted like a befuddled Senior.
“Sir, what kind of computer do you have? We detected suspicious activity and we need to resolve this now to protect you and our servers.”
“Well young lady, the sticker says Tandy 286.”
“Ummm, I’m not familiar with that brand. Where did you buy it?”
“Radio Shack about 10 years ago—- no make that 1978, and this is 2010, so that would be — now let me get my calculator— I had it here someplace…”"
6,"I had a young lady email me first, saying she had compromising photos of me. She wanted $1500. I indicated that I have no family and she had nobody to send photos to (BTW, she had no photos). I told her to bugger off.
Five minutes after I didn't answer her nasty texts, my phone rang. It was a Colorado Springs number… She told me her price was now $2500. I said I now had her phone number and I'd track her. She told me she was untraceable, and now the process was $3000.
I traced it — it was a burner phone, but she had paid for it with a real credit card. I tracked the address and punched it into G"
7,"I got legitimately freaked out this week.
This person called me on my work phone number while I was talking to a co-worker. I picked up the phone,
-Paraphrasing closely-
Me: “Hello?”
Her: <in a slightly shaken voice - a middle-aged woman immediately skips saying hello and dives into the below>
“I just wanted to let you know that I know you’ve been looking into my window and looking at me.”
(!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!What!!!!!!!!!!!!!?)"
8,"Fake car warranty company calls my cell:
Associate from scammer support (ass): Hello Ms. Mazza… mazzer… er. Hello I’m calling you today to let you know that the warranty on your 2012 Hyundai is about to expire. (Btw- my poor car has been totalled and in car heaven)
Me: oh really?
ASS: yes but I can set you up with a new warranty right away
Me: great! (Sounding overly enthusiastic). I just have a few questions first.
ASS: How many miles are on your car?"
9,"Me: “Hello.”
NOT-Microsoft support: “Hello. This is Bob Bobson from Microsoft Support. We are seeing a lot of virus activity from your device.”
Me: “Oh no. My device? Are you sure?”
NOT-Microsoft support: “Oh yes, we have many reports.”
Me: “Oh jeez. How can I fix it?”
NOT-Microsoft support: “It’s OK, sir. We can help you right now. Are you in front of your device, sir?”
Me: “Yes. I was just about to use it. I’m glad you called.”
NOT-Microsoft support: “Yes sir, we are going to help you. Can you please push the Start button?”"
10,"I got a call from “Amazon Customer Service.” That is how it appeared on my phone. The caller said that they suspected someone was fraudulently trying to use my account and to fix it, he needed my credit card number. I told him I was driving (my husband was driving, but whatever) and I couldn’t dig the card out at the moment. He asked me to set a time for him to call me back, which I did. In the meantime, I called Amazon (a) to confirm my suspicions that it was a scam, and (b) to let them know they were being used in a scam. At the appointed time, the scammer called back. I answered the phone “"
11,"I live in Thailand but answer my phone in English, mostly to weed out sales, wrong number or scam calls. Hearing English, callers usually hang up.
I was 2 hours early for a corporate teaching assignment and was at an open-air coffee shop in the 3-floor high lobby. Areas were divided by crisscross fences and potted trees.
A mobile “boiler room” group was making their calls and having coffee at a nearby table. I was seated close to the fence but hidden by a bush.
I have ‘teacher ears’ (meaning I can hear conversations from a distance), and I understand Thai.
Being bored, I listened in on some of the"
12,"A friend of mine recommends answering the phone “Fraud Detection Bureau. How may I direct your call?” when you get an out-of-state number you don’t recognize.
I got the Microsoft employee with an Indian accent call once. The conversation went like this:
“Sir, I am calling you from Microsoft. Are you aware someone is attempting to perform an exploit on your computer?”
“Yeah, that’s me. I’m a hacker. In fact, I’ve already traced your call and downloaded a virus onto your computer.”
“What! I didn’t say anything about a virus!”
“Oh, sorry about that. Well, gotta go. Good luck with that virus.”"
13,"He was a typical IRS scammer, (heavy accent, poor English, no idea how the IRS really works, etc.), but his timing could not have been worse . . . for him. And, it gave me the opportunity to have a little fun.
You see, it was mid-January 2019, and the conversation went something like this:
Scammer: I am with IRS. You have not paid taxes, and police are now coming to your house to arrest you.
Me: Oh, that’s terrible! But, I’m really concerned about you. I can’t believe you are working today.
Scammer: You should not be concerned about me. Police are coming to arrest you."
14,"It was one of those Microsoft scammers. It was 8:30 on a Sunday morning, and I just wasn’t in the mood. I said “Look, I know this is a scam. Save your time and mine - call somebody else”. No, no it wasn’t a scam, he insisted. I asked him how he could face his children at night, knowing what he did all day. Has he told his mother what he does? She must be really proud of him. He said “You can’t talk to me that way, you ***”. So I hung up.
And he called back. “You hung up on me! Why did you hang up on me?” I told him he was a lying thief and he just swore at me. I won't have strangers swearing at"
15,"A few weeks ago, a scammer contacted me by text claiming he was Mark Zuckerberg, and I had won $10,000,000 and a truck.
Mr. Zuckerberg informed me that all I had to do to get my money and my truck was to pay the $300 delivery fee. However, I was only allowed to pay by Google Play card.
I get a kick out of scambaiting, and our exchange went something like this:
(After I was informed of my winnings)
Scammer: OK, I need your name, address, email, and phone carrier.
Me: I am Pablo Escobar, of 2116 Chihuahua Avenue, Portobello, New Mexico, 86753–09, and I use T-Mobile."
16,"When my husband was alive … we LOVED messing with the scammers and unsolicited callers. It normally started with my husband acting concerned and seemingly listening carefully. And it ended with me yelling at him that I was sick and tired of him not paying attention to me while having sex and if he didn’t get off the phone immediately I was leaving him. My husband would then stammer and explain, “My wife is simply insatiable and never leaves me alone …” Then he’d hang up. They never called back.
Another story that just happened yesterday was my daughter’s phone rang … she’s six and her only acce"
17,"This just happened a few weeks ago:
ANGEL: Hello?
SCAMMER: Yes, good day. I am calling on behalf of your insurance carrier. We have an exciting new program only for clients who have had clean driving records for the last five years. This new program can save you up to 30%. Our records show you qualify for this new program. Can we sign you up for it today?
A: Car insurance?
S: Yes, it is a program offered through your car insurance policy. As you have a clean driving record, our records show you could qualify to save up to 30% on your bill with our new program!"
18,"I was in our office studying on the computer, when the phone rang. Knowing my parents were busy outside, I answered it myself.
Me: Hello?
Person: *strong accent that’s hard to understand* Is that (mum’s name)?
Me: No, it's her daughter, who is this?
“Fred”: I'm Fred, calling from (an internet provider we were not with) technical department, there is problem with your internet connection!
Me: Uh… nothing’s wrong with our internet, do you want me to get my mother?"
19,"I had one of those “Windows” calls from India one afternoon. The young man said my computer, identified by the IP address was at risk. Since I had nothing going on at the time, I decided to mess with him.
Now understand, I began my IT career in the late 70’s, and have worked continually in Telecommunications since then. The computer I use is about the fifth one I built to my own specifications, being dissatisfied with the factory machines.
I responded with, “What computer? I don’t have a computer”.
The young lad was insistent that my computer was open to hacking, and he needed to help me fix it.

20,"Cell phone rings and the caller ID comes up with my daughter-in-law’s number, so I answer it with “Hello, Trudy” and a rough, deep male voice starts into his credit card scam script. I instantly realize what is going on and interrupt with something like, “Trudy are you OK? Your voice sounds strange.” And he keeps right on with his script so after a few more interruptions by me I change over to “What have you done to Trudy? You are calling from her phone. Where are you and what do you want?” in a very upset sounding voice. After a few more repeats similar to that he just hung up on me.
When my w"
21,"I got the scammer to give me his bank account details so that I could “transfer the money” immediately. The scammer was overjoyed at thinking he was going to get a lot of my hard-earned dough. I engaged him in conversation for a few minutes, and then I told him:
I’m an officer from the National Crime Directorate, tasked with international computer fraud offences. He went silent. I thanked him for being so open with me, and so patient. I then explained that his bank account was being frozen, his voice had been recorded by speech recognition software, and finally, that his location had been captu"
22,"About 10 months after my parents passed away (they passed 4 months apart), I received a phone call on their land line:
Scammer: Hello, may I speak to Mrs. X?
Me: Who’s calling?
Scammer: This is “Joe” from XYZ Construction. We’re ready to start work on your remodeling project you contracted with us. I’ll be in your area tomorrow, and would like to pick up the $15,000 deposit that’s due in order for us to begin work. What time is good for you?
Me: We don’t have any remodeling project planned.
Scammer: Yes, you do. You signed a contract last month for us to remodel your kitchen and bathrooms. We’ve or"
23,"I like to mess with scammers, so I've had a few odd ones, but my favorite wasn't me messing with the scammer as much as timing. I was at the Phoenix IRS office, and I got a call from a scammer claiming to be IRS, from a Phoenix number. I said I would come right up, since I was in the lobby, and asked which office he was in. He called me a liar, and told me I had to go to Western Union, and wire the money. I repeated that I was in the lobby, and would come to his office and give him cash. The Secret Service was still treasury, not Homeland Security yet, and their uniformed service did security"
24,"Not really odd, but…
Woman calls about 9:30 one Monday morning telling me my insurance payments are way overdue and I must send $1,500 immediately or my car, house, and medical insurance policies will all be canceled.
I tell her my replacement leg hasn’t arrived yet, but I’ve got the cash here in my kitchen. And if she doesn’t mind seeing an amputee limping to the door could she come by and pick up the payment…?
We make an appointment for Tuesday at 1:15PM.
She arrives driving a nice Toyota SUV and leaves as a passenger in the back of the sheriff’s car.
And both of my legs remain attached just fine"
25,"Maybe it is just my imagination, but I think my “locked up” ploy has somehow made the rounds of all those backroom scam operations which call to say your computer has a virus.
Initially, I kept the “agent” and his manager on the phone for nearly an hour, until they finally just gave up. The exchange went something like this:
Scammer: Please press the Windows and CTRL key at the same time.
Me: I can’t. The computer is locked up. It won’t respond to the keyboard, and the mouse does not move.
Scammer: Turn the system off, then turn it on again.
Me: I can’t. The computer won’t shut down."
26,"I was going to pass on this question until I saw 98 people asked me to answer! WTF, people, go enjoy a good book! ;)
I had a phone scammer contact me saying he was with the IRS and he was very persistent. He had a heavy Nigerian accent and as soon as he identified himself as “Agent Johnson” (how creative) I knew what the game was. I acted like I was old and couldn’t hear well, and cooperated just enough to keep him on the line so I could screw with him more.
Scammer: “I am Agent Johnson with your Bureau of Tax Enforcement. We are putting a levy on your bank account because you owe us the money!”"
27,"I began getting calls daily from fake credit card companies offering to lower my interest rate. I quickly learned that pressing option 2 to be placed on the do not call list did not have any effect on the number of calls I received. I then decided to try engage a person to find out anything that could identify the caller to be able to report them. So my conversation goes like this:
Scammer: Yes, we can lower your interest rate. What is the balance on your credit card?
Me: What is the name of your company?
Scammer: We are credit card services.
Me: Credit Card Services ?"
28,"I’ll just post this reply of mine from 2017:
I knew this guy was a scam booger from the first seconds of his sleazy delivery. I don’t know why, but here’s how it went:
TM: Hello. I’m calling about the great number of police officers shot in the line of duty in the past few months and the devastation it has caused their families. Would you be willing to donate to Police Families Fund to help the wives and children of these murdered heroes?
Me: …. (smelling a rat) Sure. Put me down for $100. No, make it $200.
TM: Excellent, sir. Your gift will be so welcomed. And now, may I have your credit card inf"
29,"I’ve gotten the “We’re going to suspend your SS # for fraudulent activity”.
The “gentleman” with the obviously foreign accent (glad everybody is working, but seriously, we all know the accent is the first clue something is wrong) tells me he is Agent Steve so-and-so, and there has been fraudulent activity reported on my SS# and it is being suspended unless I can prove it’s mine. I ask him for the last 4 digits.
Of course, “for my security”, he can’t give me that. I have to confirm it.
I’ve given him several variations of the numbers that correspond with a certain four letter word and it was about"
30,"This incident happened 5–6 years back. There was a call on our land line phone.
On land line normally I receive phone calls from mutual fund people or people requesting to take AMC for washing machine, water purifier etc.
And they always ask for “saar”.
To know about ‘saar’ you may read my answer Vijaya Lakshmi's answer to What is the most Indian thing ever?
With a bored voice I said 'hello'
“Is it Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi?” A male voice from the other side asked me."
31,"Not sure if this was a scam, but it sounded like one… It happened when I was about 21 years old and a university student.
—————
I was about to start making a cake and just as I was getting the bowl out, I got a call.
“I got a great opportunity for you that I think you will enjoy.”
Well, I am usually a polite person, so I asked,
“Will it cost me anything?”
“No, nothing at all,” he said.
“Very well, I am listening.”"
32,"It was a beautiful sunny summer Saturday at the University of Chicago campus in Hyde Park. I was doing my class assignment when my phone rang.
Me - Hello?
A lady responded -
Lady - Hello, am I talking to Mr. Saxena?
Me - Yes.
Lady - I am calling from IRS and this call is to inform you of an illegal international money transaction you did recently.
Me - Whaaat!?"
33,"I love when scammers call so much that it is almost an obsession with me. It brings a little sunshine to my day. I can actually write scripts for when they call. My husband swears that after a conversation with me they block my number!
Here’s a few gems: Once someone called me to tell me my computer from microsoft. “Thank you God you got back to me! I’ve been waiting a week for the repair man to call. Let’s get started!”
So he tells me to start by turning it on. I say I turn it on, and he gets to the part in the spiel where he it would give him power over the computer, where I say “Damn it! It"

Using all sorts of convoluted language they get me to press windows key+r. This opens a run window. Except it doesn't say run in my language. They say, now you see a window that says run, I say no in see a window that says kør. Conversation usually goes south from there, until I start singing local Christmas songs.
They call me from windows support. And I act all thankful and overjoyed, and start going on an on about my thermo windows that are still under warranty.
We start chatting away, and I start yelling at non existing kids, dogs, cats, and ask him to start over… a"

37,"I was napping on a Friday afternoon after a grueling work week a few weeks ago. My cell phone rang with an 800 number and I ignored it. It rang again and I answered without speaking so they’d stop calling.
A voice said it was American Express fraud division and there had been suspicious charges. I picked up.
She told me my Amex number, address, and exp date. She then asked if I’d purchased a one way airfare from Iowa and a Walmart charge from the same area. Nope.
I asked her what my last legit charge was on the card and she knew. I also looked up the number she was calling from and it looked legi"
38,"I have a home office and I was at my desk when I got a call from “Microsoft support,” saying that my computer might have been at risk and to check if X program was running (a standard MS service that is always running). I checked and said, “Oh my God, it is running. What should I do?”
She said they could help but would need remote access to my computer and started to give me directions on how to do when I said, “Oh, oh. The boss will be here in a few minutes and we’ve got dozens of computers. I’m going to go shut them all off before he gets here. Give me your number and I will call you back as"

40,"Just last Saturday morning. I live in Germany so I speak German. Early morning the telephone rang and since I was close I picked it up. After 5 or 6 seconds - so that I guessed it was a scam - an Indian accent came on and asked if I spoke English. I very tentatively volunteered that I could a little ( I each English at the Uni). A man introduced himself as John from Microsoft. Being polite, I introduced myself as being Ramjam.
John then said ""You have a Microsoft right""
No, I don´t I replied

""You´re sending me a c

41,"A few days ago got a spoofed call from ""911"".
A male voice asked for me and I confirmed that it was me. He then introduced himself as a cop and said he had a warrant for my arrest.
This isnt possible for numerous reasons.
911 will never call you
Police will not call you and tell you, they will find you
The whole vibe was shady
With that gut feeling, I told him it was illegal to impersonate a police officer and exaggerated some stuff about it being a felony and him going to jail. I dont know about all that, just wanted to scare him."

TM: Please, it’s a really good offer, and everyone loves going on vacations."
45,"I get so fed up with these. In Canada we have the no call list, but all they did was move the call centers out of the country. So, obviously the calls come in with predominantly East Indian accents. I happen to have some very good East Indian friends and understand a little of their culture, a strong point of which is how much respect and care they have for their elders.
Scammer: The usual greetings, including the name (today it is Arun), a request for my name and how I am doing today.

I got the standard ‘This is Windows Support” call from India. “We are calling to tell you your computer has been hacked, there are viruses on your hard drive, and we need to help you get them off because they are infecting the rest of the Internet.”
So I played along for about fifteen or twenty minutes, until we got to the download part of the scam, and I told him I did not have an internet connection. There was a silence on the other end of the line,
“You don’t have internet?”
“Nope, no internet.”
The guy was stunned. After a m"
51,"It was a typical IRS scammer with an Indian accent and a bland American name, say, Joe Black. Something that is also relevant is that prior to becoming a psychologist, I was a CPA—I specialized in taxes.
Joe Black called me and ran through the typical litany of errors on my tax returns, charges have been filed, sheriff’s on the way unless I’m willing to pay up.
Instead of doing my usual, “Look buddy, you really called the wrong person. I was a CPA who worked on tax matters,” and hanging up, I decided to have fun with him.

I told him that it was obvious that he was doing a scam, and how he felt about endeavoring to swindle people, asked him if his mother and father would be proud of a son who was a cheat.
He shed some tears, said he hated his job, was throughly ashamed of himself and we had a long discussion of how he ended up doing this, w"

He had an Indian sounding voice and there was a lot of background chatter sounding like he was in a call center. So right away I became suspicious.
He said my Internet connection was ‘sending out’ some kind of viruses and he wanted to access my computer remotely to fix it..
He had some personal details correct. Like my ISP and what plan I was using. He was very convincing; however, I was smart enough to realize what was happening.
The first mistake he made was introducing himself."

The scammer was pretty excited about this, and agreed that that would be a great idea.

He tries to talk and again I interrupt saying all about the happy years we had and how people don't believe me when I tell them we never had one single argument in the 18years we were married.
I thanked him for listening to me and then said I realised th"
445,"Had the decorator round painting my ceilings when the phone rang - I answered it on loudspeaker, it went like this:-
Me “Hello?”
Telephone Scammer (TS) “Hello madam, we have noticed a problem with your internet and there is an attempt to steal money from your bank”.
Me: Oh no! What do I need to do?
TS: Check your internet router!
Me: Whats an internet router?
TS: the thing that makes your computer work!
Me: Oh, my husband deals with all the computer things shall I get him to call you back?"
446,Well this is very odd and funny and amazing. To give the most detail possible this will be kind of lengthy but great none the less. You know how when a scammer calls then you can screw with them then the line goes dead? Well in this case it went a bit different. In my case the same group called me around a dozen times over a week. And I blocked the number but somehow they kept calling with the number I had blocked. So at that point i figured what the hell and pulled my car over (after they called 4 times in a hour) and started trying to call. They answered confused asking who I was. I told the
447,"It was a year ago almost to the day even.. I was working at a convenience store and someone had called the night before telling an employee they were from OSHA and needed to schedule a time to come in to the store. They told him to call back the next day. My boss was all freaked the next morning telling me about it when I got there. However, I was laughing. Mainly because I know darn well that they would not schedule an appointment for an inspection. They would just show up. So, I got the number off the caller ID at work and used a VOIP phone number I have and call the guy back. I asked him wh"

449,"I keep scammers on the phone for as long as I possibly can. The longer that I can keep them talking the less time they have to con gullible people. They deserve all they get. I play along with everything that they say, so that they believe I am really interested in whatever the scam is. All scams involve wanting my bank details so that they can get my money, there is no other reason for them calling me, yet they really seem to think that they can con me out of my hard earned money. It saddens me that so very many people are prepared to give details of their bank account etc. so that these scam"
450,"Lots of amusing and clever tales so far.
Mine isn’t, in itself. My phone rang, and an officious voice started to talk about computers. I was in a foul mood anyway, it was 8 a.m., I was having breakfast, I”d answered the phone knowing that at that time In the morning it might be bad news. So you steady yourself for the worst, and it’s just this bastard who, it seems, wants to start going on about suspicious activity on your account. Before he could get into his stride, I told him to fuck off, and put the phone down. An hour later at the office there was an email from Dell computers saying that t"
451,"Something like this.
Hello, I am calling because you took part in a phone interview before where you were asked about how bad people think the state is and that they only take their money
Me: I have never taken place in such an interview, how did you get my contact data?
Phone: I would like to inform you of the results of the interview
Me: I can assure that I have never given you any interview
Phone: The interviews have determined that most people think they have not enough money because of the state and they would like to have more money."
452,"This one wasn’t a telephone scammer, it was someone trying to pull what you’d call a “fake grant” scam on Facebook.
To make it short - I am friends on Facebook with an older woman whom I’ll call “Justine Porter”. I don’t know her personally, but I was friends with her son Ruben, and am also Facebook friends with her other son, Eric.
The scammer made a bad imitation of Justine’s Facebook page, sent m"
453,"When I have enough time, I let the scammer explain that my computer has a technical problem, has reported it to MS tech support, etc. He advises me tzo login at my computer (sorry, not so fast, needs some minutes to boot … OK, I can login).
Scammer: please press windows key
I: what?
Sc: the key at the bottom of your keyboard, drectly right of ctrl
I OK … nothing happens.

Sc: OK, please open a browser and surf to (some remote control software)"
