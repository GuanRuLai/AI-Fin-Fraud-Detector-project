Heavy Indian- like accent woman tells me she is with the national survey company.
She just needs me to answer a few questions.
She told me that they are not allowed to do that.
she woke me up at 10:30 at night
She reluctantly agreed as long as i would answer her questions.
She replied she was in Idaho.
She said the same time it is there.
"Her- its just a few questions, 2 or 3 minutes to complete."
She asks if i am registered to vote.
She replied that if i would just answer YES or NO to question 1 we could finish this important and required poll.
he's not allowed to tell me the full name well the full legal name of his company and he's not allowed to tell me the location of that company.
Buddy did break it down that on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays his floor will be calling and selling Medicare part A and part b. On Tuesdays and Thursdays his floor will be selling burial insurance.
Now the bottom floor of his building 1/2 pretends to be the CIA or the FBI the stating that they will come to arrest you unless you pay a fine and the other half pretends to be social security pretty much the basic same deal.
Then on the weekends his floor and other floors either call you pretended to be Amazon the law enforcement foundation or some other type of charitable event.
And the social security and the FBI thing that works just like you've seen it in the movies they rip you off they get you to send money and they tell you you're not going to prison and hang up they laugh they move on with life.
They are fully willing that if you go get a gift card and donate to these they just take the money they tell you thank you and you think you've done something nice when in reality you're paying for somebody's damn Audi.
If they are able to get you with the social security bureau or one of the other scams where they actually get your social security your identity they have a field day with you....
He stated that people that get big returns on the money get bonuses people to do the basics they just get a paycheck.
"He did that when they tell you you were on a recorded line that's only halfway right, only certain sections of the building are recorded so they can use phone calls as training"
so if you've ever had a scammer and get mad and tell you to go to hell he's not being recorded cuz their boss isn't too 100% down with that unless you call them a racial slur if you guess which Providence or country they're from.
He states that there are guys and girls that have been doing this since the age of 14 and love it. I've been trying for quite a while to get one of these guys to break and talk to me so I can record it on my other phone but just so happens I was at work and bored and I didn't have the other phone handy.
He did state that they do sit in the call center and there are at least three bosses to walk around and monitor them.
If they are heard saying any certain phrases like where they're from or the address of the building it's their ass...
Because apparently it's a lot cheaper to pay supervisors to walk around and monitor you then it is to pay for a large recording system.
Now the reason he came clean is because some of this have pieced together watching YouTube videos and other people saying how they work and whatnot so I called him out on a bunch of it...
I told him I said you got my number you know I'm just Joe blow come clean with me.
And boy did he ever...man oh man.
You are online just minding your own business and surfing the web like normal.
"Suddenly, your screen flashes after launching an unfamiliar website."
You don't notice anything different so you keep on surfing.
"Caller ID says ""unavailable"" or ""computer support""."
"Caller ID says ""unavailable"" or ""computer support""."
"They tell you it's your antivirus provider and that they have information that you visited xxx site and have become infected with the xxx virus (enter your own ""X"" here)."
"They ask you to visit their remote support site (which could even be a legitimate site,"
"but you never know who's on the other end of it!) and join a support session,"
where they get access to your computer
But I've had clients who willingly gave up control of their computer to an unknown party in an unknown location.
Wake UP!!!!
"Antivirus software can't help you when you bypass it,"
nor can malware blockers keep up with ALL the nastiness out there.
Long story short (I know...
"too late for that!),"
"keep a good antivirus program on your computer,"
"keep it always up to date,"
same thing with a anti-malware program.
"At least once a month,"
run a complete virus scan and malware scan after updating your definitions and programs.
"And,"
"unless YOU have paid for an online support program from a reputable company that you have heard of (and that didn't call you on the phone and sell it to you!),"
"never let anyone take control of your computer,"
especially if THEY call YOU and tell you something!
Be paranoid about your computer.
"It will save you time, money and headaches from Identity Thieves."
Blessings always!!

It was a lot of experimentation and fun.
Now I put them all together in a playlist. Enjoy!
ATT GOT ANOTHER SCAM CALL TODAY. THIS TIME FROM NICARAGUA.
BE AWARE N ALLERT
Unplugged the phone last night three calls around midnight just dead air
I received a call today from “Andrew” who was asking for donations for POLOFFICERSCOA His number was 307-248-9133.
"Andrew, began with a long intro about Police and how they need our support."
I let him go on and on and he said he would send me a donation form in the mail and asked if I could guarantee to donate $50 or $25.
"I told him I would be more than happy to,"
but once I read all the information you send.
"He then said,"
people usually guarantee that $25 would be fine with them and could he put me down for a $25 guarantee.
"Again, I said that I would be more than happy to donate,"
but AFTER I receive the information and will decide on the amount then.
I could not promise any specific amount at this time.
[I knew EXACTLY what he was and enjoying wasting his time LOL].
"He went on to ask if I could at least afford and guarantee $15 – again,"
"I told him that once I’ve read your information,"
I would be more than happy deciding on the amount.
He hung up!!! LOLOLOLOL
LAST WEEK IT WAS A DANISH MOBILE NUMBER THAT SCAM CALLED ME
02087470967 Owner Information
Who called me from +442087470967?
Here you get phone information of the number 02087470967.
"It is a landline phone number of 27 Mayfield Av, W4; London; W4 1PN of UK / United Kingdom."
rung on when I answered
"This phone number belongs to Miss J Elton, Proprietor."
Got a phone voice message 4 months ago about a complaint filled against me.
These people are too much.
214-584-9528
This number has called my 61 year old mother at midnight and 3am.
Lots of heavy breathing so not sure if is just a pervert or a scam call.
Fake Bank Website.. number is not 800 number and goes to a private voicemail.
This is CLASSIC SCAM. Piece of crap no interpretation!
I got this call today.
Currently working phone number for Refund Scam:
They are awaiting your calls.
567-244-0491
P.S. is this mainly a US group?.
"just asking as we have different laws over here, different freephone numbers,"
geographical numbers etc.
........all best.....
"When you try to scam a scammer,"
they do not have a sense of humor.
Someone really wants my contact info.
"Got A call from this number,"
it read Marjorie something.
Caller ID is awesome
Hell I pray it was not the nutjob Marjorie Taylor Greene
Can any enlight who this is?
So it goes on.........
"(fortunately, I'm not falling for them)."
Call this morning...
no.
displayed 07121 1276063 claimed to be calling from VISA
"Press 1 for confirmation, etc.'"
informing me' I have had £600 taken out of my account'.
"sounded like a set, badly, recorded voice!"
Didn't listen to any more.

"Calling,"
"and saying my name,"
in a distressed way.
"I remember reading about this scam,"
"and not to call back, but I forget what the whole scam is?"
"When they called me,"
said my social security was being suspended.
First they call you with an automated message asking for a call back (I called back cause I knew it was a scam and wanted more info to give out to the public).
"Over the call they ask for your name (obviously give them a fake one),"
"social (again, give a fake one), and never ask for your address but somehow ""know where you live"" (complete lie of course)."
"The dude that called me was ""Mike Brown"" but had a thick accent that couldn't be hidden."
"One can hear people talking in the background,"
as if it were a call center
Lost his temper a bit with how uncooperative I was.
"Then gave up after I called him a scammer,"
"revealed that normally when people fall for it they get them to pay money in return for taking away the allegations and keeping them from ""suspending"" one's social security."
Have fun!!_
"Tired of getting bitcoin ""Manager"" who calls from unknown number."

So I called the SS office in Mumbai 20 times.

Hi - many thanks for letting me join!
I posted this on my timeline the other day:
Joining some 'phone scam' groups.
(I have a keen interest in consumer laws & issues & don't generally have 'MUG' on my forehead!).
"Many of us know about these types of calls already,"
"but a 'timely' warning as this was the first one,"
"so far,"
I have received!
Scammer purporting to be my BANK 'we have noticed a possible unauthorised payment gone to payee abroad of £600' 2 options given
NEITHER of which I pressed but hung up
then dialled 1471 to check no.of caller: 01223 639802 in my case.
Lots of these happening.
These scammers are taking advantage of many people's anxieties...
& try to catch us out.
"If I'm already multi-tasking & sitting at my desk anyway,"
"then get actual person at other end,"
I'm quite happy to 'waste their time'!
"If you're feeling vulnerable,"
"ill,"
etc.
just hang up!
Here's a useful website:
Working phone number to computer tech scammers - 833-540-0822.
SCAM ALERT
787-528-9090
They will call and say your ATH MOVIL is suspended
They keep suspending my Social Security a few times per month. 
social security scam 720 649 4133
Missed call Tunisia presume its a scam
I found this in my voice mail today.
I got this call just yesterday.
"There are people who do this called ""tax attorneys."""
They have degrees and are admitted to the bar.
They do not need to spend thousands of dollars on cold calls to look for customers.
413-461-4959 just called and I answered but no one would speak.
I told them to lose my phone number.
I called them back and got an outgoing message I haven't heard before!
"All agents are busy with other colors,"
"please call back."""
Then it hangs up on you.
I'll keep trying though.
"I think this is the second time some organization offered to forgive my student loans, during the past month."
The problem is that I do not have student loans.
Well this is new...
Text messages saying meeting is on and be sure to notify (anyname) to come with you.
If you respond they say oh my assistant have me the wrong number...
so sorry…
This seems innocent so you say no problem...
it is over but it is not.
For your troubles the want to send you a gift card or free meal or something.
I have gotten three of these this month.
It is a phishing scam to get your info.
This was the last one:
"I tell them that thier cAll is liligal and was automatically transferd to the police,"
"nothing seems to stop them,"
"they have all said a rude word as they put the phone down,"
ok been on my own since feb and am now bored
Seems that one of the current scams is you fill out an application for something...
a rewards card at a store...
you name phone number and location is there.
they ask you to go to there website (a social media portal) and up load an avatar or picture...
they sell all this information because it belongs to them...
it is in the fine print.
I have gotten more calls from Pain Management centers and Male Enhancement/Testosterone supplements in the last few weeks...
also what you purchase with the rewards card.
just because I have one of those tags on my key ring...
for a vitamin store.
Proud to have kept a scammer online for 5 minutes.
Apparently I ordered a laptop (after I literally just had to replace mine from cat terrorist activities) oh and the phone # was almost the same as mine. 
"$5,000!!!"
For a laptop!!!
FYI Amazon doesn't call you to alert you that you made a purchase.
Or call and ask you if you want to cancel.
Beware 
Be nice to your phone scammers!
They might be family
